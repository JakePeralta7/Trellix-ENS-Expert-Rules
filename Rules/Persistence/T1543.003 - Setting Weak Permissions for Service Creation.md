# T1543.003 - Setting Weak Permissions for Service Creation

## Author
Elad Levi

## Description
Users with standard level access they cannot create a service in Windows environments. This privilege belongs only to elevated users such as Local Administrators. 

However, modification of the security descriptor permissions for the service control manager could allow also any user to create a service that will run under the context of the SYSTEM account.

Using the security descriptor definition language these permissions could be modified by executing the command below:

`sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)`

## Rule Class
Processes

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
	Initiator {
		Match PROCESS {
			Include OBJECT_NAME {
				-v "**"
			}
		}
    }
	Target {
		Match PROCESS {
			Include OBJECT_NAME { 					
				-v "sc.exe"
			}
			Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE {
				-v "** sdset**scmanager **"
			}
			Include -access "CREATE"
		}
	}
}
```
