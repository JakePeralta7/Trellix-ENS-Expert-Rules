# T1562.002 - Disable Security Auditing via auditpol

## Author
Elad Levi

## Description
Additionally, adversaries may use auditpol and its sub-commands in a command prompt to disable auditing or clear the audit policy.
To enable or disable a specified setting or audit category, adversaries may use the `/success` or `/failure` parameters. For example, `auditpol /set /category:"Account Logon" /success:disable /failure:disable` turns off auditing for the Account Logon category. To clear the audit policy, adversaries may run the following lines: `auditpol /clear /y` or `auditpol /remove /allusers`.
